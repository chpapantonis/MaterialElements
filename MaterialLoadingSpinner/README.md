## Material Loading Spinner
### Usecase
This spinner is based on material design and can be used when doing some backprocessing or an async call or ... in general when you need for the user to wait. 

### How to
There is a ploject with a dummy view controller instantiating the spinner view and adding it as a subview. There is an initialiser with all the necessary parameters as arguments to make the spinner configurable:

* Stroke Width
* Stroke Color
* Size of the spinner
* Background of the frame
